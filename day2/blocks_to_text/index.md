# Moving From Blocks to Text Coding

## About

In this session, you will learn about:

- The differences between *Blocks*, *Hybrid* and *Text* Languages
- Why you might chose a particular type of Language to teach Coding to your students
- Examples of different *Blocks*, *Hybrid* and *Text* Languages

After a presentation about moving students from Blocks languages to Text languages, there will be an activity where you use Coding and Mathemt. Sonic Pi is a program that allows you to write music with code. Like Scratch, itâ€™s easy to get started Coding this tool, but you can also write quite complex programs (compositions) using it.
