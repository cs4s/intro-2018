# Creative Computing with Scratch

## About

In this session you will learn about another approach for teaching Coding: through the creation of *Projects*.
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a free Coding tool and community that is commonly used for creating Coding projects, particularly in K-6 education. The creators of [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) argue that students learning to Code should be encouraged to develop projects that are personally meaningful to them and that Coding can help students express themselves. Consequently, *Scratch* has been designed to: be easy to create projects in (*low floor*), allow for customisation and multiple solutions (*wide walls*), and be capable of handling large and complex projects (*high ceiling*).

The [Creative Computing Curriculum Guide](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/) is an example of a resource that encourages an approach to the teaching and learning coding that emphasises the creative and personally meaningful aspects of computing. 
This guide contains 7 different themed units (such as *Stories*, *Games* and *Animations*) which each contain activities, starter projects and *Debug It!* activities.
The guide has been developed for *Scratch* but some of the guide's activities could be adapted for other coding languages.

The design of the *Creative Computing Curriculum* is centred on **four main principles**:

- **Creating:** offer opportunities for learners to engage in designing and making, not just listening, observing, and using.
- **Personalising:** offer opportunities for learners to engage in activities that are personally meaningful and relevant.
- **Sharing:** offer opportunities for learners to engage in interactions with others as audience, coaches, and co-creators.
- **Reflecting:** offer opportunities for learners to review and rethink their creative practices.

[Dr Karen Brennan](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/faculty/karen-brennan){:target="_blank"} conducted research into how students and teachers used Scratch and her findings from this research also influenced the design of the *Creative Computing Curriculum*. 
The main focus of Dr Brennan's research was understanding how educators (in schools and in informal learning environments, such as libraries) balanced learners' *structure* and *agency* when teaching coding with Scratch.

In this session, we will work through some of the activities in Unit 1 (*Exploring*) and Unit 2 (*Animations*) of the *Creative Computing Curriculum Guide* together.
You will also learn about another **Computational Concept** (*Parallelism*) and build on your understanding of *Sequences*, *Loops* and *Events*.
You will also have the opportunity to engage in a **Computational Practice**, when you learn about what *remixing* in Scratch is.
